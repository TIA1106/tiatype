🙋‍♀️ Why I Built This
I wanted a writing app that didn’t distract me, but also helped me improve.
So I built TiaType — a smart writing environment backed by modern AI.
It’s more than a frontend toy — it taught me LangChain, OpenAI integration, MongoDB, and building a clean user experience.

This is my journey into serious full-stack development with AI.
